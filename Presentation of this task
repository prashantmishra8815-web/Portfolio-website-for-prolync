##short presentation for this project 

“Our first task was to build a portfolio website using HTML and CSS as core technologies, with JavaScript and React encouraged for advanced features.
I created a responsive portfolio website with Hero, About, Projects, and Contact sections.
The folder contains index.html, style.css, script.js, and an assets folder.
JavaScript adds smooth scrolling and interactivity; React can be used for reusable components in the next stage.
